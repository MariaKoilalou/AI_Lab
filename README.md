# AI_Lab
This repository contains all of the lab assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course of Maria Koilalou and Justine Le Bourg. 
Each lab assignment is organized in a separate folder containing the necessary files.


## AI_Lab 1

The `AI_Lab1` folder contains the files for our first lab assignment, which includes:

- A report in PDF format describing the methodology, results, and conclusions of our project. See [AI_Lab1.pdf](AI_Lab1/AI_Lab1.pdf).
- A Python script named `variant.py` which implements the machine learning model discussed in the report. See variant1.py](AI_Lab1/variant1.py).
- A Textile file named `maze.txt` containing the documentation and instructions for running the Python script. See [maze.txt](AI_Lab1/maze.txt).
