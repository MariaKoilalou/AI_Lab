# AI_Lab
This repository contains all of the lab assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course of Maria Koilalou and Justine Le Bourg. 
Each lab assignment is organized in a separate folder containing the necessary files.

## AI_Lab 1
The `AI_Lab1` folder contains the files for our first lab assignment, which includes:

- A report in PDF  `AI_Lab1.pdf` format describing the methodology, results, and conclusions of our project.
- A Python script named ai_lab1.py which implements the machine learning model discussed in the report.
- A Textile file named ai_lab1.textile containing the documentation and instructions for running the Python script.
